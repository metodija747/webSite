  <li>The Sword in The Stone, sometimes referred to as Caliburn is the sword that belonged to Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon and only really has two abilities. If it's put into a stone or anvil it can only be removed by the chosen king of England even if it's been removed. The sword can also shine a bright, blinding light. I'm not sure how or if Arthur can control the light. It just happens.</li>

Excalibur is the sword crafted by faeries and given to Arthur by the Lady of The Lake. It is supposedly indestructible and in some legends can cut through almost anything. In other legends it's just a really good sword that can't be destroyed. It also can shine a blindingly bright light. The scabbard is the most important part though. When Arthur has the scabbard on him he is immune to all harm. This is why Morgan steals the scabbard from him.</li>
